# Anagram Checker
## Description
This Javascript function checks if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is the result of rearranging the letters of a word to produce a new word.Anagrams are case insensitive, meaning the function treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.
## Functionality
* The `areAnagrams` function takes two strings as input and returns true if the strings are anagrams of each other, and false otherwise.
*  It normalizes the strings by converting them to lowercase, splitting them into an array of characters, sorting the characters, and then joining them back into a string.
* It then compares the normalized strings to determine if they are anagrams.
## Examples
### Example 1
Input: "foefet", "toffee"
Output: true
### Example 2
Input: "Buckethead", "DeathCubeK"
Output: true
